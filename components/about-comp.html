            <p>Hello, I'm Siddhesh Deshpande. I have completed my Engineering in Computer Science
                from Mumbai University. After that I have been working as a backend developer for 3 years.</p>

            <p>I have developed this website as a part of Bridge Batch training at Wissen Technology in Feb 2024. Front
                end
                tech stack is new to me and it was a great experience learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I
                have
                especially enjoyed learning to use Bootstrap to build responsive websites.</p>

            <p>I hope to continue this learning journey to become a full stack developer.</p>
